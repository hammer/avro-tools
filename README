A collection of tools for working with Avro. Currently:

* avrocat: using the Python bindings for Avro, read in an Avro file and write out the data as text.
* pprint_avsc: a tool to compare and pretty print Avro schemas.
* license_spacing: make the Apache 2.0 license declarations conform to PEP 8 style guidelines.
